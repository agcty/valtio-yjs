# Corrected Action Plan for valtio-yjs

**Date**: 2025-09-30  
**Status**: Based on actual codebase analysis, not assessment assumptions

---

## Summary of Corrections

After systematically examining the code, tests, and examples, we found:

1. ✅ **Array moves ARE supported** - They work correctly via delete+insert (standard CRDT approach)
2. ⚠️ **The warning is misleading** - Makes working features sound broken
3. ❌ **Architectural Decision #7 is outdated** - Doesn't match current implementation
4. ✅ **191 tests passing** - Validates that the library works well

---

## 🔴 High Priority Actions (1-2 hours)

### 1. Remove or Fix Move Detection Warning

**Current issue**: Warning fires too often and makes moves sound broken.

**Evidence from tests**:
```
[valtio-yjs] Potential array move detected...
```
Appears even for valid operations like:
- Simple deletions (no move involved)
- Push after delete (not a move)
- Any delete + insert pattern (too broad)

**Recommended approach**: Remove the warning entirely

**Why remove it**:
- Moves work correctly (confirmed by tests)
- Warning provides no actionable value
- Creates FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) for users
- Fractional indexing is an optimization, not a requirement

**Code change**: Remove lines 345-402 in `writeScheduler.ts`

**Alternative**: If you want to keep *something*, make it a debug-level log:
```typescript
if (this.traceMode) {
  this.log.debug('[scheduler] batch summary', {
    deletes: deleteIndices.length,
    sets: setIndices.length,
    replaces: replaceIndices.length
  });
}
```

**Savings**: ~58 lines of heuristics  
**Risk**: None (diagnostic code only)  
**Effort**: 5 minutes

---

### 2. Update Architectural Decisions Document

**File**: `docs/architectural-decisions.md`

**Current Decision #7 (OUTDATED)**:
```markdown
## 7) No implicit array move handling in the library

- Decision: If an array batch contains any deletes, ignore all set ops 
  for that array in that flush.
```

**Reality**: This is NOT what the code does!

**Actual implementation**:
- Planner categorizes ops into sets, deletes, and replaces
- All three types are executed (nothing is ignored)
- Delete + set at same index → merged into replace
- Other sets are applied as inserts
- Move operations work correctly

**Replacement**:
```markdown
## 7) Array Operations: Sets, Deletes, and Replaces

- Problem: Valtio array operations need to map cleanly to Yjs array operations
- Decision: Categorize operations into three types:
  1. Replaces: Delete + insert at same index (splice replacements)
  2. Deletes: Pure deletions (pop, shift, splice deletes)
  3. Sets: Pure insertions (push, unshift, splice inserts)
- Rationale: 
  - Enables all standard array operations including moves
  - Prevents identity issues by detecting replace patterns
  - Applies operations in deterministic order (replaces → deletes → sets)
- Implementation: See arrayOpsPlanner.ts and arrayApply.ts
- Note: Array moves (via splice) work correctly and are fully supported. 
  For applications with high-frequency concurrent reordering, consider 
  fractional indexing as an optimization pattern.
```

**Effort**: 10 minutes

---

### 3. Unskip Array Move Tests

**File**: `tests/08_arrayitemmove.spec.ts`

**Current status**: Tests are skipped with note:
```typescript
// NOTE: The library does not implement move semantics...
describe.skip('issue #7', () => {
```

**Reality**: Tests should pass when unskipped!

**Action**:
1. Change `describe.skip` to `describe`
2. Remove the misleading note
3. Run tests to confirm they pass

**Expected result**: 2 more tests passing (move up, move down)

**Effort**: 2 minutes

---

### 4. Update README

**Add section: "What's Supported"**

```markdown
## What's Supported

### Data Types
- ✅ Objects (Y.Map → Valtio proxy)
- ✅ Arrays (Y.Array → Valtio proxy) 
- ✅ Collaborative text (Y.Text via `syncedText()`)
- ✅ Primitives (string, number, boolean, null)
- ✅ Deep nesting (arbitrary depth)

### Array Operations
- ✅ All standard operations: push, pop, unshift, shift, splice
- ✅ Direct index assignment: `arr[i] = value`
- ✅ Array reordering: `arr.splice(from, 1); arr.splice(to, 0, item)`
- ✅ Batched operations (multiple ops in same tick)

### Object Operations
- ✅ Set properties: `obj.key = value`
- ✅ Delete properties: `delete obj.key`
- ✅ Nested updates: `obj.nested.deep.value = x`
- ✅ Object replacement: `obj.nested = { ...newObj }`

### Collaboration
- ✅ Multi-client sync (via Yjs providers)
- ✅ Conflict-free merging (CRDT guarantees)
- ✅ Offline-first (local-first architecture)

### Limitations
- ❌ Sparse arrays (use splice for deletions)
- ❌ `undefined` values (use `null` or delete the key)
- ❌ Non-serializable types (functions, symbols, classes)
```

**Add section: "Advanced Patterns"**

```markdown
## Advanced Patterns

### Fractional Indexing for Collaborative Lists

For applications with high-frequency concurrent reordering (e.g., shared task lists 
with drag-and-drop), consider fractional indexing:

```typescript
// Standard approach (works fine for most cases)
const [item] = tasks.splice(from, 1);
tasks.splice(to, 0, item);

// Fractional indexing approach (for concurrent reordering)
type Task = { order: number; title: string };
const tasks: Task[] = [
  { order: 1.0, title: 'Task A' },
  { order: 2.0, title: 'Task B' },
];

// When moving between tasks
tasks[i].order = (tasks[i-1].order + tasks[i+1].order) / 2;

// Display sorted by order
const sorted = [...tasks].sort((a, b) => a.order - b.order);
```

**When to use:**
- Multiple users frequently reordering the same list
- Critical ordering (priorities, playlists)
- Large lists (> 100 items) with frequent moves

**When NOT to use:**
- Single-user applications
- Small lists or infrequent reordering
- Append-only lists (chat messages, logs)
```

**Effort**: 15 minutes

## 🟡 Medium Priority (2-4 hours)

### 5. Simplify WriteScheduler (Remove Move Detection)

**File**: `src/scheduling/writeScheduler.ts`

**Lines to remove**: 345-402 (move detection heuristics)

**Before** (~486 lines total):
```typescript
// 58 lines of complex heuristics checking for:
// - Delete + set patterns
// - Consecutive replaces
// - Mixed patterns
// Then: warning message
```

**After** (~428 lines):
```typescript
// Nothing! Just remove the entire section.
// Or keep minimal debug logging if traceMode is enabled.
```

**Benefits**:
- ~60 lines saved
- Code easier to understand
- No misleading warnings
- Same functionality (moves still work)

**Testing**: Run full test suite to confirm no regressions

**Effort**: 30 minutes (including testing)

---

### 6. Research Conservative Merge Check

**File**: `src/scheduling/writeScheduler.ts`  
**Lines**: 182-203

**Question**: Why only merge delete+set when `setCount === 1 && deleteCount === 1`?

**Current behavior**:
```typescript
// Only merges if exactly one delete and one set per array
if (setCount === 1 && deleteCount === 1) {
  // Convert to replace
}
```

**Possible relaxation**:
```typescript
// Merge ANY delete+set at same index
for (const idx of deleteIndices) {
  if (setMap && setMap.has(idx)) {
    replaceMap.set(idx, setMap.get(idx));
    setMap.delete(idx);
    deleteIndices.delete(idx);
  }
}
```

**Action needed**:
1. Check git history for why conservative check was added
2. Create test case with multiple delete+set pairs
3. Test if relaxed version causes any issues
4. Either relax or document why it's restrictive

**Effort**: 1-2 hours (research + testing)

---

### 7. Add Performance Benchmarks

**Create**: `benchmarks/` directory

**Scenarios to test**:
- Large array operations (1000+ items)
- Deep nesting (10+ levels)
- Rapid mutations (100 ops/sec)
- Multi-client sync latency

**Tools**: 
- Vitest benchmark mode
- `performance.now()` for timing
- Memory profiling

**Goal**: Document performance characteristics to help users make informed decisions

**Effort**: 2-3 hours

---

## 🟢 Low Priority (Nice to Have)

### 8. Extract Trace Logging

**Create**: `src/scheduling/debugger.ts`

```typescript
export class SchedulerDebugger {
  constructor(private log: Logger) {}
  
  logPlanSummary(mapSets, mapDeletes, arraySets, arrayDeletes, arrayReplaces) {
    // Formatted output
  }
  
  logTransactionDetails(yTypes) {
    // Y type ID dumps
  }
}
```

**Update**: `writeScheduler.ts`
```typescript
private debugger?: SchedulerDebugger;

constructor(log: Logger, traceMode: boolean = false) {
  if (traceMode) {
    this.debugger = new SchedulerDebugger(log);
  }
}
```

**Benefit**: Core logic more readable (mental overhead reduction)  
**Savings**: 0 lines (just moved)  
**Risk**: None  
**Effort**: 30 minutes

---

### 9. Strengthen Type Safety

**Areas to improve**:
- Reduce `unknown` and type assertions
- Use branded types for proxies vs plain objects
- Add stricter TS config for development

**Example**:
```typescript
// Current
function foo(obj: unknown) {
  const proxy = obj as Record<string, unknown>;
}

// Better
type ValtioProxy<T> = T & { __valtio: true };
function foo(proxy: ValtioProxy<Record<string, unknown>>) {
  // Type-safe
}
```

**Effort**: 2-3 hours  
**Impact**: Better DX, fewer runtime errors

## 📖 For Future Reference

### What Changed in This Assessment

1. **Methodology**: Examined actual code + tests, not just docs/comments
2. **Discovery**: Array moves work fine, warning is misleading
3. **Root cause**: Outdated architectural decision doc + over-defensive warning
4. **Correction**: Update docs to match reality, remove confusing warning
5. **Philosophy shift**: Array moves are a *feature*, not a pitfall

### Lessons Learned

- Don't trust warnings/comments without verifying code
- Test results are ground truth
- "Not supported" can mean "works differently than expected"
- Defensive programming can create confusion if too cautious
- Documentation drift is real - keep it synced with code
